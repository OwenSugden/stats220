## What's going on with my bus?

This report analyses the busyness levels and the average minutes late my buses are. I was able to explore how busyness levels (based on the number of people on the bus) vary across the buses I take in a week and how many minutes late my buses are on a certain day in the week.

```{r}

# Define the CSV file URL
csv_file <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTQulEdNNYOnQH-JxQ5L9VXtdYhdSCYaGAruXFseapxGaCH9-efR_R5_zJHFsKtTyg_ZPjg2M9uu3sa/pub?output=csv"

# Read the CSV file
logged_data <- read_csv(csv_file) 

# Change the variable to latest_data and rename the columns
latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(day = 2,
         time = 3,
         minutes_late = 4,  
         busyness_level = 5,  
         experience = 6)
```

## Summary Values

### max_minutes_late

```{r}
max_minutes_late <- max(latest_data$minutes_late) 
max_day <- latest_data$day[which.max(max_minutes_late)]
paste0("The latest a bus has been so far is ", max_minutes_late, " minutes. The day that has the latest bus is a ", max_day,".")
```

### busyness_count

```{r}
busyness_count <- latest_data %>%
  count(busyness_level) 
max_busyness_count <- max(busyness_count$n)  
max_busyness_level <- busyness_count$busyness_level[which.max(max_busyness_count)]
paste0("The highest count of busyness level is ", max_busyness_count," the busyness level with this count is ", max_busyness_level,".")

```

## Bar Charts

```{r}
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")), 
                 y = minutes_late, fill = day)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
  labs(title = "Average Minutes Late by Day", x = "Day", y = "Mean Minutes Late")
```

```{r}
ggplot(latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = busyness_level, fill = busyness_level)) +
  labs(title = "Count of Busyness Levels", x = "Busyness Level", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
